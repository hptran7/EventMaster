## About the Project

- Event master is a event sharing apps. At its basic, Event master is about highly customizable rapid event invitation creating. In addition to normal event creation, this app allows users to notify their guests about any changes, updates, or warning about covid exposure.

## Usage

- Visit [BujoToGo](http://event-master-dc.surge.sh/) and sign in as guest(username: guest // password: password).

- Add, edit, and delete event, or find and public event and send out invitations. Events are stored with date time strings and returned in chronological order based on the time range of the view.
